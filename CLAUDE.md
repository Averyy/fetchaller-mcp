# fetchaller-mcp

MCP server for fetching any URL without domain restrictions. Full Reddit support. Built-in web search.

## Architecture

fetchaller owns content processing + MCP tools. wafer (`~/code/wafer`) owns HTTP transport + anti-detection. fetchaller NEVER does bot solving, impersonation, or cookie management — if a site blocks requests, fix it in wafer. See `docs/architecture.md` for full details.

### Reddit

Normal Reddit URLs use New Reddit's logged-out anonymous JSON path, except the
wiki page index, which first reads New Reddit's canonical SSR page tree and,
when that exact tree is unavailable or its exact anonymous route returns an
unstructured 403, posts `WikiPageRevisionsV2` to the fixed
`www.reddit.com/svc/shreddit/graphql` route using the same anonymous session's
`csrf_token` cookie. Public wiki parity must pass anonymously. fetchaller has
NO Reddit credential path at all -- no OAuth, no client ID/secret, no refresh
or access token -- and must never gain one. Routes Reddit serves only to a
logged-in account (exact moderator rosters, account-private vote activity)
return an explicit account-gated error and are covered offline as
`fixture_only`. Wafer >=0.4.6 owns verification/cookie persistence;
fetchaller owns strict URL mapping, SSR/API schema validation, and compact
rendering. Never add an Old Reddit fallback or copy wafer's
verification parser into this repo. Explicit `.json` stays raw JSON and
`raw=true` fetches canonical New Reddit HTML. Preserve Reddit's public score as
a score (not an upvote count); show `upvote_ratio` only when returned, and never
invent separate up/down vote counts.

## Pre-Commit Rules

**ALWAYS run lint and tests before EVERY commit. No exceptions.**

```bash
.venv/bin/ruff check src/ tests/   # Lint (import sorting, style)
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -x -q   # Tests
```

If ruff fails, fix with `.venv/bin/ruff check --fix src/ tests/` and verify again. CI runs `uv run ruff check src/ tests/` — if you skip this locally, the push WILL fail.

## Testing Rules

**ALWAYS use wafer** (not `urllib`, `requests`, or `httpx`) for HTTP requests — wafer handles TLS fingerprinting and bot protection transparently.

**ALWAYS manually test** every new feature/site before committing. Unit tests alone are not sufficient. See `docs/testing.md` for full testing guide (writing tests, live testing, test organization).

## Development & Testing

**CRITICAL**: When testing changes to this MCP server, you MUST use the local version, not the production Docker image.

1. **Update MCP config** to use the local Python:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "fetchaller": {
         "command": "/Users/avery/Code/fetchaller-mcp/.venv/bin/python",
         "args": ["-m", "fetchaller.main"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
2. **Restart Claude Code** to reload the MCP server with local changes
3. **Test the changes** using the fetchaller tools

Do NOT test against the production version (Docker image from GHCR).

**The MCP server caches loaded module code.** Even with the local config, the running fetchaller process loaded `src/fetchaller/**/*.py` at Claude Code startup. New modules and edits do NOT take effect until you restart Claude Code (or otherwise restart the MCP server process). When live-testing changes inline, run them via `.venv/bin/python -c "..."` against the fresh source on disk to confirm the code is correct before restarting.

## Landing Page

`landing/` contains the static site deployed to fetchaller.com. Read `docs/design-style-guide.md` before any visual changes. Always invoke the `frontend-design` skill (`/frontend-design`) when making visual changes.

**`landing/llms.txt`** — LLM-readable project summary. **Keep this in sync when adding new tools, sites, or features.**
